## How to Use the Public JSON API Service - No API Key Required ;-)

Use the "raw" links served by GitHub (
otherwise you get the complete "formatted" GitHub page). Example:

```
$ curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openfootball/football.json/master/2015-16/en.1.clubs.json
```


## Updates / Contributions Welcome - Please Update the Source Text Files

Note: The JSON files get (auto-)generated using the football.db datasets, thus, **please do NOT
edit the JSON files but the source text files in the country repos** e.g.:

- English Premier League in [`/eng-england`](https://github.com/openfootball/eng-england)
- Deutsche Bundesliga in [`/de-deutschland`](https://github.com/openfootball/de-deutschland)
- Spanish Primera Divisi√≥n ("La Liga") in [`/es-espana`](https://github.com/openfootball/es-espana)
- Italian Serie A  in [`/it-italy`](https://github.com/openfootball/it-italy)
- and so on



<!--
## Automate, Automate, Automate


If all works weekly updates get pushed by yorobot.
See the [`yorobot/football.db`](https://github.com/yorobot/football.db) build scripts for
the (auto-)update machinery.

  todo: add how to build your own json files from the source datsets - why? why not?
